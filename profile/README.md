# Ultramarine Linux

Ultramarine Linux is a Linux® distribution based on Fedora® Linux. Our goal is to design an experience which satisfies the beginner with the simplicity, while retaining the features a power user would demand.

This project has recently been migrated over from a private GitLab instance, which can be found at [gitlab.ultramarine-linux.org](https://gitlab.ultramarine-linux.org). 

With the move to GitHub we aim to be more transparent, and plan to provide unified information about the current state of the project and future plans.
