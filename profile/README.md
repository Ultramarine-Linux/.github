# Ultramarine Linux

Ultramarine Linux is a Linux® distribution based on Fedora®. Our goal is to design an experience which satisfies the beginner with the simplicity, while retaining the features a power user would demand.

This project has recently been migrated over from a private GitLab instance, which can be found at [gitlab.ultramarine-linux.org](https://gitlab.ultramarine-linux.org). Please note: until we reorganize things and settle on a structure, most of the repositories will be private and only progressively rolled out to the public. (You can find all repos on the private GitLab for now)

With the move to GitHub we aim to be more transparent, and plan to provide unified information about the current state of the project and future plans.
